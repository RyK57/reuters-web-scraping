# reuters-web-scraping
 a Python script that scrapes data from the Reuters website, integrating it with the News API, and storing the scraped data in a structured data file (CSV or JSON). The objective I primarily had was to collect information about headlines, links, summaries, descriptions, and sources of news articles.

Approach:
To accomplish the task, I followed the following approach, leveraging my technical knowledge:

Data Scraping from Reuters Website:

Utilized the requests library,for sending HTTP requests in Python, to interact with the Reuters website's JSON API endpoint.
Send an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint using the requests.get() function, providing the URL as the input.
Checked the response status code using the response.raise_for_status() method. This ensured that any HTTP errors, such as 404 or 500, would raise an exception, allowing us to handle them appropriately.
Extracted the JSON data from the response using the response.json() method, which parses the response content as JSON and returns a Python dictionary.
Accessed the "headlines" key in the JSON data to retrieve a list of articles.
Iterated over the articles using a loop and extracted the required information, such as the title, link, and summary, using dictionary indexing.

Constructed the complete article link by appending the article's relative URL to the base URL.
Integration with the News API:

Utilized the requests library to integrate the script with the News API, which provides additional information about news articles.
Obtained an API key from the News API service, allowing access to their API endpoints.
Constructed the request URL for each article by combining the base URL ("https://newsapi.org/v2/everything") with the required query parameters.
Included parameters such as the API key, the article headline as the search query, the desired page size, language, and sorting criteria.
Send an HTTP GET request to the News API using requests.get() with the constructed URL and parameters.
Checked the response status code using response.raise_for_status() to handle any potential errors.
Extracted the JSON data from the response using response.json() and accessed the necessary information, such as the article description and source, from the "articles" key in the JSON response.
Handled cases where the News API did not return any articles for a given search query by providing default values for the description and source.

Storing Scraped Data in a Structured Data File:

Leveraged the csv module in Python to store the scraped data in a structured manner using the CSV file format.
Defined the file path for the CSV file, such as "reuters_scraped_data.csv".
Created the CSV file using the open() function with the appropriate file mode ("w" for writing) and encoding ("utf-8").
Specified the fieldnames, i.e., the column headers, as a list of strings ("Title", "Link", "Summary", "Description", "Source").
Created a DictWriter object from the csv module, passing the file object and field names as parameters.
Wrote the field names as the header row in the CSV file using the writer.writeheader() method.
Iterated over the scraped data list, which contained dictionaries of article information.
Wrote each dictionary as a row in the CSV file using the writer.writerows() method, which accepts an iterable of dictionaries.


Challenges:

While developing the Python script for data scraping, integrating with the News API, and storing the data in a structured file, I encountered the following challenges:

Both the Reuters website and the News API imposed certain limitations on the number of requests that can be made within a given timeframe. To ensure compliance and avoid being blocked or throttled, I had to implement appropriate measures to handle rate limiting. This involved managing request frequency, incorporating delays between requests, and implementing error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle API errors and timeouts.

The Reuters website also  employs dynamic web content loading techniques, which means that not all data is readily available in the initial page response. Some content may be loaded asynchronously or upon user interaction. To overcome this challenge, I used the website's JSON API endpoint to directly access the required data. However, it required careful analysis of the API response structure and adapting the scraping code accordingly.

When scraping data from the Reuters website, it was crucial to ensure the integrity and quality of the collected information. In some cases, the API response may not provide complete or accurate data. To address this, I implemented robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. For example, if an article did not have a summary available, I included a default value or skipped that article entirely.

Also, Storing the scraped data in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON, presented its own set of challenges. I had to design an appropriate data structure to hold the scraped information and ensure its compatibility with the selected file format. Additionally, I needed to handle potential issues like encoding errors, file I/O errors, and maintaining the correct structure of the file to ensure easy retrieval and usage of the stored data.
