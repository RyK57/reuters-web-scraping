# reuters-web-scraping
 a Python script that scrapes data from the Reuters website, integrating it with the News API, and storing the scraped data in a structured data file (CSV or JSON). The objective I primarily had was to collect information about headlines, links, summaries, descriptions, and sources of news articles.
